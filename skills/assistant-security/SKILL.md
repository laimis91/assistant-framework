# Analyze Security Risks

## Shared operating guidance

Load [the common outcome guidance and shared stagnation policy](../../tools/progress/operating-guidance.md) for this activity. Keep specialist methods, authority and completion evidence below; single-pass work needs no progress artifact.


Inspect the requested surface and report concrete attack paths, their impact, and the smallest useful remediation. Infer scope and method from context; ask only when missing source, access, or deployment facts prevent a trustworthy conclusion. Keep analysis read-only unless remediation is authorized. When the request is to decide what to do with an incoming security advisory or vulnerability report rather than to analyze code, use `assistant-advisory-triage`.

Load the relevant reference, using only checklist categories that apply:

| Analysis | Reference | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| Threat model | `threat-model.md` | Trust boundaries and threats; STRIDE where useful |
| Code review | `code-review.md` | Reachable vulnerabilities in changed code |
| Dependency audit | `dependency-audit.md` | Actual dependency versions and exposure |
| Attack surface | `attack-surface.md` | Entry points, privileges, and integrations |
| Agent and tool authority | `agent-authority.md` | Untrusted content steering agents and tools, delegated authority, approval binding, durable context |
| Installer and filesystem ownership | `install-boundaries.md` | Writes to user-owned or shared locations: markers, links, shared roots, path overlap, sentinels |
| Dependency and release provenance | `release-provenance.md` | Who influences resolution, artifact identity, CI as authorization, which release contains a fix |

Load a boundary companion (the last three rows) only when the assessed target has that surface: agent, tool, prompt, memory or task-state flows; installer or other writes to user-owned files; dependency resolution, CI or release artifacts. An ordinary web or API request loads none of them.

For a detailed requested threat model, `prompts/threat-model.md` provides additional prompts. Check relevant paths such as authentication/authorization, tenant isolation, untrusted input, data access, shell/process execution, file paths, network integrations, serialization, dependency/configuration risk, and privacy/logging. Do not turn an irrelevant category into a finding.

Each finding needs specific redacted evidence (file/line, configuration, dependency, or threat path), a reachable attack or misuse path, impact, severity, remediation, and a verification step. Separate demonstrated behavior from assumptions. Do not invent vulnerabilities or report generic advice as findings.

Every reported security item is in one of two states:

- **Confirmed**: the source trace and observed or bounded local evidence establish the lower-trust actor, the input or action, the crossed boundary, the affected principal or resource, and the result. Only confirmed items are findings and receive severity.
- **Needs validation**: a specific source-grounded boundary hypothesis is blocked on a named runtime, deployment, provider or host fact. State the hypothesis, that blocking fact, and a safe check an owner can run. It carries no severity.

Generic advice that is neither is not reported. In prose output, list needs-validation items under a **Needs validation** heading, separate from the findings. Respect the requested severity threshold and order findings by material risk.

Use a consistent severity scale:

- **critical**: immediate exploitation or breach risk;
- **high**: significant vulnerability needing attention before release;
- **medium**: material weakness with limited or conditional exploitability;
- **low**: minor exposure or defense improvement.

State the assessed scope, result, and confidence; report residual risks, inaccessible areas, and evidence gaps that limit a clean conclusion. Omit empty reporting sections. If structured output is requested, preserve `findings` with `severity`, `category`, `description`, `impact`, and `remediation`; include evidence and attack path, `summary`, highest material `risk_level` (or `none`), and prioritized `action_items` when findings require fixes. Put needs-validation items in a separate `needs_validation` list (each with `hypothesis`, `blocking_fact` and `safe_check`), never in `findings`. When this perspective runs inside a Review specialist pass that returns the canonical Reviewer schema, map each needs-validation item to an `observations` entry with the blocking fact in `evidence_gap` and the owner check in `follow_up`, never to `findings`.

For an explicit full or comprehensive audit, list the assessed surfaces, the blocked surfaces with their blocker, and the excluded or out-of-scope surfaces with the reason. Call the audit complete, or report no findings for it, only when no in-scope surface is blocked or unassessed; otherwise label it partial.

Never paste, log, or repeat secret values; redact and cite location only. Use local/repo-native checks where available. Do not claim OS-level isolation the host does not enforce. Running target scripts or installers stays within existing authorization, and fixture execution follows assistant-review's `script-execution.md` rules; when a check needs isolation that is unavailable, report the item as needs validation with a safe validation plan. Do not upload proprietary code, install scanners, or call external scanning services without authorization. If a credential exposure or active exploit path is found, promptly report the redacted evidence and required containment within the authorized scope; do not claim broad safety from inaccessible evidence or perform unapproved remediation.
