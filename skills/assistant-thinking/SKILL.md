# Think Through the Decision

## Shared operating guidance

Load [the common outcome guidance and shared stagnation policy](../../tools/progress/operating-guidance.md) for this activity. Keep specialist methods, authority and completion evidence below; single-pass work needs no progress artifact.


Choose the smallest reasoning method that helps answer the question. Use local evidence and user constraints, distinguish facts from assumptions, and make uncertainty visible. Do not turn clear execution into deliberation or expose proprietary source, secrets, or sensitive logs to external tools.

| Method | Reference | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| Clarify | `clarify.md` | Assumptions and constraints are tangled |
| Perspectives | `perspectives.md` | Viable alternatives or conflicting drivers need distinct viewpoints |
| Stress Test | `stress-test.md` | A proposal needs a strong challenge |
| Deep Think | `deep-think.md` | Hidden concerns or criteria need exploration |
| Hypothesize | `hypothesize.md` | The cause is unknown and evidence must distinguish explanations |
| Creative | `creative.md` | Naming or unusual options need variety |

Read the relevant method on demand and scale its depth to the stakes. Use only the lenses, hypotheses, or rounds that can change the conclusion. For broad option generation, use `assistant-ideate`. Ask every material, non-discoverable question that changes the recommendation, with the impact and a safe default where available.

Ground alternatives and trade-offs in concrete constraints. Include the strongest counterpoint or dissent where it affects confidence, an evidence-calibrated recommendation, and a useful validation or rollback step. Hypotheses need distinct predictions and disconfirming tests; do not invent extra causes to reach a quota. Record actual observations and distinguish confirmed, refuted, and inconclusive results.

Return a concise synthesis, evidence, relevant alternatives/dissent, recommendation, and remaining gaps. Stop after analysis unless implementation is requested. If the method cannot be applied with available context, report the gap rather than inventing analysis.

## Independence and Delegation

Thinking perspectives are discretionary outside selected research-lens or formal
review methods. Resolve architecture directly when sufficient; optional specialist
execution may help. Independent high-risk challenge or acceptance judgment uses a
newly created reviewer with fresh context. Sequential role-play is not independent
evidence. Preserve sandbox, approvals, external-write, cost and secrets boundaries.

## Integrated and Structured Output

Apply [`contracts/input.yaml`](contracts/input.yaml), [`contracts/output.yaml`](contracts/output.yaml), and [`contracts/phase-gates.yaml`](contracts/phase-gates.yaml) for workflow/preparation calls and requested supported structured output. Keep their existing schema v6 fields; ordinary reasoning does not require the serialized envelope or phase checkpoints.

When challenging a supplied Architecture Decision Pack, check freshness and return the compact `architecture_pack_update`, preserving boundary, type, design-pressure, and quality-verification implications. Do not create a Pack for an ordinary question. `review_intensive` updates retain independent challenge reference, dissent or validation, resolution, and selected-design impact. Do not claim memory, performance, or extensibility benefits without workload, budget or explicit unknown, measurement method, and failure condition.

Deep Think concerns in existing-system preparation remain candidates until workflow evidence validates promotion. A validated candidate must match exactly one current input `{evidence_ref, item_id, claim_or_question}` binding and retain the exact output triple. Missing, stale, mismatched, duplicate, or extra bindings stay candidate-only. Omission from requirements/design alone does not create a requirement or Product question.
