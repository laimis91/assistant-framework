# Test-Driven Development

Use TDD only when requested, required by project policy, or activated for selected
checks by the carried verification decision. Scope, technique, and TDD are
independent; inactive TDD never needs a fabricated RED.

## Cycle

1. **RED.** The writer adds or extends a meaningful behavior assertion. Run it
   and observe the intended missing-behavior failure before production edits.
   Syntax, imports, environment, and flaky failures do not authorize production.
   If it passes, inspect existing behavior and the oracle; do not remove working
   code or invent failure evidence.
2. **GREEN.** Make the smallest production change that passes. Verify the target,
   selected relevant regressions, and applicable binding checks. Repair failures
   before moving on; do not infer an unselected full suite. Classify failures
   against accepted behavior before repair; incidental assertions do not justify
   production changes. Keep carried reduced-testing scope and cumulative workflow
   repair limits across tests, checks, workers and sessions.
3. **REFACTOR.** After current GREEN, improve names or remove duplication only
   when useful; `none needed` is valid. Record actual changes and run a distinct
   REFACTOR verification, even when no refactor was needed.

Keep actual test identity, commands/argv, cwd, observed outcomes, and why RED
failed for the right reason. Partial cycles remain partial; an exception needs
its recorded approval/reason and cannot be called TDD completion. Reused checks
need no fabricated test edits.

## Workflow ownership

For workflow/producer boundaries, load `contracts/index.yaml`: `entry`, active
`current_phase`, and `completion` preserve the existing canonical cycle log and
gates. Missing/invalid selectors load the full named file. Workflow owns dispatch.
Load workflow's `references/build-worker-protocol.md` only when that execution
path is selected.

- `bounded_executor`: one owner authors tests, observes RED, implements, and
  verifies GREEN and REFACTOR.
- `separated_workers`: the SAME selected writer authors tests (`test_authoring`),
  implements after current RED (`production`), and refactors after current GREEN
  (`refactor`). Builder/Tester executes checks only. Test-authoring DONE is
  stage-only and cannot complete Build or permit Review.

Preserve the unchanged decision, task-wide `tdd_mode`, and selected IDs. Workflow
activation is their intersection with `tdd_choice.applicable_check_ids`; split
active packets until exactly one ID intersects. Authorizing RED must match that
CheckSpec's exact ID, test file/name, argv/cwd, and meaningful-failure oracle.
Changed authorizing inputs require fresh RED without erasing history. Standalone
TDD without a decision invents no CheckSpec ID.

For a carried Architecture Decision Pack, test its semantic conversions,
validation, compatibility, design-pressure behavior, and stated quality scenarios.
Do not invent a Pack, benchmark, or quality claim. Unknown-cause bugs go through
assistant-debugging before selecting the regression oracle.

## Result and stop rules

Return the cycle evidence, changed test/production files, relevant verification,
exceptions, and blockers; preserve the canonical log for actual consumers.
Missing or invalid required RED blocks production (`NEEDS_CONTEXT` for delegated
writers). Wrong-reason RED requires a test/environment repair; failed GREEN or
REFACTOR blocks the next behavior. Ask only about unresolved material behavior
or oracle choices, with no numeric question quota.
